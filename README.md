# Exploration and analysis of Search-based versus Sampling-based motion planning algorithms.

<h1><b> Overview </b></h1>
This project aims to conduct a comprehensive comparison between search-based and sampling-based motion planning algorithms. Specifically, the A* and RRT* algorithms are evaluated and analyzed. The performance of the A* algorithm is further investigated by exploring various heuristic functions. The comparison is conducted across seven distinct environments, each featuring 3D obstacles, to provide a robust assessment of algorithmic capabilities and limitations.
